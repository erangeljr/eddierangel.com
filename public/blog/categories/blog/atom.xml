    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you a part of an Agile Software Development Team? How do you know? I&rsquo;ve been reading the Agile Project Management book by Jim Highsmith. In his book he says, &ldquo;Agility is principally about mindset, not practices.&rdquo; In his book he recommends asking yourself and/or Project Leaders a set of questions to assist in determining whether you have an agile mindset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what specific ways and with what practices do you focous on value first and constraints last?&rdquo;
&ldquo;In what specific ways and with what practices do you manage teams rather than tasks?&rdquo;
&ldquo;In what specific ways and with what practices do you adapt to change rather than conform to plans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I was reading through the first couple of chapters, I found myself relating to a lot of the pit falls people experience when they&rsquo;re working on Teams who are Agile In Name Only. Don&rsquo;t be AINO!</p>

Of pink champagne and swimming pools
Well, all you have to lose is your virginity
Perhaps we&rsquo;ll have some fun tonight
So stick around and take a bite of life
We don&rsquo;t need feebleness in this proximity&rdquo; - Primus</p>
