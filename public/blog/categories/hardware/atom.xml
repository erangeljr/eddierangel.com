    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I installed my 16 GB&rsquo;s of RAM in my Mac Book Pro. It&rsquo;s purring like a kitten. Over the last couple of nights I built a new VM for my Windows Hacking. It&rsquo;s running 8.1 along with VS 2013 and MSSQL 2012. Plus some extras like Resharper. I really like having the additional RAM, it really helps when you want to leverage more of the technology you have.</p>

<p>I also updated this site with some plugins. Adding Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn. I also threw some google analytics on here.</p>

<p>This site is still in active development. I have a goal to try to contribute everyday to my GitHub repositories. I&rsquo;m using this site as a launching pad to get me into a habit of hacking outside of work. I have a couple of side project I&rsquo;ve been working. I hope to have an MVP up and running soon.</p>

<p>Check you later&hellip;</p>
