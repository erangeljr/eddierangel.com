    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I installed my 16 GB&rsquo;s of RAM in my Mac Book Pro. It&rsquo;s purring like a kitten. Over the last couple of nights I built a new VM for my Windows Hacking. It&rsquo;s running 8.1 along with VS 2013 and MSSQL 2012. Plus some extras like Resharper. I really like having the additional RAM, it really helps when you want to leverage more of the technology you have.</p>

<p>I also updated this site with some plugins. Adding Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn. I also threw some google analytics on here.</p>

<p>This site is still in active development. I have a goal to try to contribute everyday to my GitHub repositories. I&rsquo;m using this site as a launching pad to get me into a habit of hacking outside of work. I have a couple of side project I&rsquo;ve been working. I hope to have an MVP up and running soon.</p>

<p>Check you later&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I finally upgraded the Mac Book Pro to OS X Mavericks. That&rsquo;s Version 10.9.1. So far it&rsquo;s working as anticipated. I&rsquo;ve been poking around
to make sure nothing has broken. I&rsquo;ve ordered some RAM to take it to 16 GB&rsquo;s, given that I&rsquo;m now using this device as my primary hacking platform. I needed more
memory to support my Virtual Machines. Happy Hacking!!</p>
