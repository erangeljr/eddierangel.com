I recently read a an infograph that indicated reading 15 minutes everyday exposes you to 1,000,000 words a year. Growing up, I never fealt like I was a strong reader. I remember being in elementary school and feeling like I was a slow reader. It seemed that all of my peers would breeze through there reading, while I was still there slowly chugging along. Although I was a slow reader, I never had a problem with comprehending what I was reading. So, it's not like a had any challenges learning from what I was reading. 

As I transistion into being a young adult, I still felt that my reading was subpar. I remember taking my first set of college level english courses and having reading assignments that consisted of reading novels. I remember thinking, reading that much in a semester is like impossible for me. I was really frusterated with me feeling like I could not keep up with my reading assignments. I felt as though if I was going to be successful in school and in life, I needed to make more of an effort to read.

Shortly after my college career began, I took a leave of absense for a few years to "get my mind right." I joined the Navy. It was at this time that I made the conscious effort to begin reading. I began reading about things that interested me. I think one of the first novels I read was Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh. I was a fan of the movie and thought that it would be an interesting book to read. It probably took me a good 6 months to read that book. I remember when I finished it, I felt a sense of accomplishment. Like I could read more than an article and enjoy it. From there I started buying more books. I read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson in 4 - 5 months. Somewhere in there I read Nake Lunch by Willam S. Burroughs. That book was nuts. As I continued on my reading journey, I felt like I was doing something good for myself. 

I no longer feel self conscious about the rate at which I read. I know I am able to read a lot faster then I did previously.
